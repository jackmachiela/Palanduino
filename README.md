This project creates a small IoT device that displays data off an internet service. Everything works so far, but the rotary encoder dial hasn't been implemented yet. I'll work on that over the weekends.

Currently it only shows the current Covid-19 data for my country (New Zealand), but the idea is that eventually the rotary encoder allows you to "dial" in to any number of channels; Youtube followers, Facebook Likes, current weather, whatever.

The hardward I'm using, a cheap cChinese NodeMCU Arduino ESP8266 unit, has one more readable pin (analog A0), but I want to have a good think about how to use that. I kind of wanted to add an LED to it, to warn that there are channels that need attention, but we'll see.
